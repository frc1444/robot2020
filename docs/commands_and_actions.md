# Commands/Actions
Because this project doesn't rely on WPILib, we do not use their command framework.
Instead, we use [action-lib](https://github.com/retrodaredevil/action-lib)

### Documentation
action-lib doesn't have the best documentation, we may switch to something else in the future.

Command framework documentation:
* https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/
* https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/convenience-features.html
