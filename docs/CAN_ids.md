# CAN IDs
Just some ideas for a convention for our CAN IDs:
* Don't use 0
* 1 through 9 are used for Talon SRX Swerve Modules
* 10 through 19 are used for Talon FX Swerve Modules
* 20 through 29 are used for mechanisms using Talon SRXs
* 30 through 39 are used for mechanisms using Victor SPXs
* 40 through 49 are used for mechanisms using Talon FXs
* 50 through 59 are used for mechanisms using Spark MAXs
* 100 is our PDP
